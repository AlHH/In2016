<p class="FirstNormal">“First Settlement” … “Third Settlement” … “Fifth Settlement” (al-Tagammuʿ al-Awwal, … al-Thālith, … al-Khāmis) … “Road 90”… Neither the names of the quarters nor the street names in the New Cairo district (al-Qāhira al-Jadīda) seem to originate from a particularly creative imagination. One eventually gets to New Cairo after a 25–30 km ride from Cairo’s old city centre, through the desert to the southeast of the Egyptian capital, on seemingly endless motorways, as boring and uninspired as the bureaucratic-pragmatic number-names of many of the quarters and streets. There are no architectural landmarks either and it is easy to get lost in this vast monotony that by now covers more than 30,000 hectares of the Greater Cairo area. Yet it is here—and in many other similar places in the country, mostly in the vicinity of the bigger cities—that they are situated, the “paradises on earth,” as ubiquitous advertisements praise them: the so-called </span><span class="T6">compounds</span>, including numerous gated communities, which in recent years have become the destination of a veritable “exodus”</span> (</span><span class="T41">Abaza</span> [b], 425) </span><span class="T90">[</span><span class="T23">→</span><a href="Migration.html" class="ListLabel_20_129"><span class="Internet_20_link"><span class="T34">Migration</span></span></a><span class="T90">]</span>. The rich and upper middle cl</span><span class="T90">ass people who are settling in these new areas seem </span>to find here—or at least hope to find—what they evidently feel is missing from other places in the city, values and a quality of life that also the billboards all along the roads and TV and Internet ads are eager to promote: </span></p><p class="Quote">Enjoy the luxury of a full-service residential community away from the noise and bustle of the capital. Located in the heart of vast green spaces, fresh air and sunshine, the </span><span class="T6">Agadir Garden City Compound</span> means calm and peacefulness, in perfect harmony with nature combined with architectural beauty, uniting beauty and creativity with the highest standards of luxury. Special services and security as well as maintenance and cleaning services are provided for every unit separately, ensuring enjoyment, comfort and tranquility.

In the eyes of some, it is true, Downtown Cairo may have retained some of its previous charm, thanks to its still lively cultural scene, as a movie like “The Last Days of the City” (</span><span class="T6">Ākhir ayyām al-madīna</span>) suggests; but those who appreciate this are only a tiny minority—mainly artists and intellectuals. Most others feel repelled, or even “ejected,” by the dehumanized “hell” of Downtown, to the new satellite cities in the desert (</span><span class="T41">Abaza</span> [b], 425), and</span></p><p class="Quote">Gated communities spread vastly in the Egyptian real estate market especially among the rich due to privacy, prestige, quality of life, segregation [...].

(</span><span class="T41">El Sayed</span>)</span></p><p class="Standard">It feels different indeed</span><span class="T6"> </span>to live in a compound.

Moreover</span>, the movies also underline those aspects of compound life that obviously are most striking for spectators who are </span><span class="T6">not</span> living there (and probably will never have the means to do so), i.e., the vast majority of the country’s population.

unlike the majority of the people who rather detest dogs—they only know those emaciated dirty creatures that are living in the streets—your dog has a health certificate and lives in conditions that many an ordinary citizen can only dream of;

once here, you can do great shopping in one of the giant air-conditioned malls, those temples of consumerism that give you the illusion of being somewhere else, in the West or, rather, in the Arab Gulf—to some observers, the malls are strong indications of a “Gulfification” (</span><span class="T6">khaljana</span>) of life in Egypt (cf. </span><span class="T41">Abaza</span> [</span><span class="">b]</span>, 441): known to many Egyptians who have spent some time of their lives as migrant workers in the Gulf, the </span><span class="T6">khalījī</span> version of an imagined Western lifestyle has become the model they consciously follow, inhabitants and construction companies alike.</span></p><p class="Standard">With all these features, the new cities on the periphery are to a large degree independent and self-sufficient, so that many inhabitants only rarely feel a need to go to the old parts of the city (</span><span class="T41">Abaza</span> [</span><span class="">b]</span>);

Probably not either. For although the compounds fit almost ideally into the picture of a modern, developed Egypt that official propaganda is eager to spread [</span><span class="T23">→</span><a href="Voice_from_Above.html" class="ListLabel_20_130"><span class="Internet_20_link"></span></span></a><a href="Voice_from_Above.html" class="ListLabel_20_130"><span class="Internet_20_link"><span class="T34">The Voice from Above</span></span></a>], and although the façades of this world probably appear even more beautiful, modern and developed in fiction than in real life, yet the compounds are mostly shown to be populated by dubious, false and criminal inhabitants, often close to the regime and/or involved in politics, who accumulated their wealth through theft, corruption, and even murder. In </span><span class="T6">The Nile Hilton Incident</span> (a movie based on real events!), the rich entrepreneur Shafīq Bek whom we meet once on a golf course, once in his luxurious villa with spacious, splendid, ultra-clean toilets at which the hero, a petty policeman-detective, only can marvel, is both a member of parliament, connected to the (Mubārak) regime, and behind the murder of a prostitute; in </span><span class="T6">Nawwāra</span>, the owner of the impressive gated palace where the eponymous heroine is employed as a housemaid, belongs to a super-rich family and is eager to transfer his assets to some bank account in the West immediately on hearing that there may be some kind of redistribution of illegally acquired capital shortly after the Revolution; and in the Ramaḍān series </span><span class="">“Beyond Suspicion” </span>we meet a devilish psychopath, member of parliament she too, but also a scrupulous murderer, and holder of a fake PhD. The overall message: the dazzling external beauty and perfection of the artificial new desert cities conceals crimes committed by “those on top” against the toiling innocent man in the street [</span><span class="T23">→</span><a href="True_vs_False.html" class="ListLabel_20_130"><span class="Internet_20_link"><span class="T34">True <em>vs</em> False</span></span></a>, </span><span class="T23">→</span><a href="System_vs_People.html" class="ListLabel_20_125"><span class="Internet_20_link"><span class="T34">“The System” <em>vs</em> “People”</span></span></a>]. </span></p><p class="Standard">To mark the villainy of the false and criminal compound-inhabiting elite, popular productions can play on widespread misogyny and xenophobia</span>—quite significantly, Raḥma, the arrant villain in “Beyond Suspicion,” is a woman [</span><span class="T23">→</span><a href="Male_vs_Female.html" class="ListLabel_20_117"><span class="Internet_20_link"><span class="T34">Male <em>vs</em> Female </span></span></a>] and blond, i.e., Westernized [</span><span class="T23">→</span><a href="Suspect_Foreigner.html" class="ListLabel_20_130"><span class="Internet_20_link"><span class="T34">The Suspect Foreigner</span></span></a>]. Less lurid productions refrain from such bluntly stereotypical characterizations. But they, too, are eager to underline the enormous divide that is gaping between the rich and the poor in today’s society [</span><span class="T23">→</span><a href="Affluence_vs_Destitution.html" class="ListLabel_20_130"><span class="Internet_20_link"><span class="T34">Affluence <em>vs</em> Destitution</span></span></a>]. Both </span><span class="T6">Nawwāra</span> and </span><span class="T6">The Nile Hilton Incident</span>, for example, draw their dramatic dynamics from the opposition between representatives of the lower and lowest classes, on the one hand, and exponents of the rich and influential—compound-inhabiting—elite, on the other. In </span><span class="T6">The Nile Hilton Incident</span>, a petty policeman-detective becomes the ‘attorney’ of a murdered prostitute as well as the protector of a Sudanese room-maid, an innocent migrant worker, representing those on the utter margins of society, who happened to see the murderer leave the scene after committing the crime and who, as an eyewitness, is now in danger of being killed by Shafīq Bek’s henchman. In </span><span class="T6">Nawwāra</span>, the social chasm is underlined through a juxtaposition of scenes from the heroine’s life at home, in the popular quarter or slum, and the giant villa to and from which she commutes on a daily basis. As if to make the spectator feel the enormous gap that separates ‘those on top’ from ‘the people,’ the movie follows Nawwāra several times on her way from home to the villa and back, each way a trip of up to two hours or more on which she also has to change means of transportation two or three times, from </span><span class="T23">→</span><a href="Tuk-tuk.html" class="ListLabel_20_124"><span class="Internet_20_link"><span class="T34">Tuk-tuk</span></span></a> to microbus to ordinary bus to compound-internal connecting services, etc. Moreover, the social chasm is not only expressed spatially but also with the help of the masters’ dog:</span> Nawwāra has to feed “Butch” (!) with five kilos of high-quality meat per day, while for ordinary Egyptians, including her own family, meat is unaffordable, except perhaps on holidays. Thus, the fact that the animal is shown to actually lead a better life than a subordinate and enjoy more privileges than the vast majority of the population quite literally turns the non-compound-dwellers into ‘underdogs.’ </span></p><p class="Standard">There is probably a lot of truth to the picture that popular productions paint of life in the compound districts as compared to other parts of the city. Massive social inequality is an undeniable fact, which is why it is a recurring theme also in cartoons. Similar to its often lachrymose dramatization in cinema or soap operas, the witty, pointed representation in cartoons, too, mostly seeks to reclaim moral superiority while the artist knows all too well that, materially, s/he is on the side of the losers </span><span class="T71">[</span><span class="T23">→</span><a href="Inferiority_eq_Superiority.html" class="ListLabel_20_130"><span class="Internet_20_link"><span class="T34">Inferiority = Superiority (Satire)</span></span></a><span class="T71">]</span>. On a few occasions, however, such sketches are used, somehow cynically, by the compound agencies themselves. A cartoon showing half of the city occupied by a dense agglomeration of shanty-like buildings, inhabited by a large amount of desperate-looking people, and the other half taken by only one luxurious villa and its surrounding gardens, with two happily smiling men relaxing on deck-chairs at the side of a swimming pool, one of them praising God “for the grace of living in such a safe, developed and humane place,” is used by Beverly Hills Egypt to promote their own compound on Facebook. (After many comments filled with outrage and indignation, this “worst ad at the closing of 2016” was removed from the web the same day—</span><span class="T41">Abbas</span>).</span></p><p class="Standard">Although highlighting important aspects of social, economic and political reality, fiction and satire are certainly also partial misrepresentations. For it is not only the uppermost echelons of society who choose, and can afford, to live in New Cairo. There is also a significant group of upper middle-class, for example AUC students. Usually these live in 4–5 storey buildings rather than in large villas, as the super-rich do. And there seems to be a general tendency to attract more and more of these than of the super-rich. Many, if not most Egyptians seem to have given up hope that living conditions may have a real chance to change significantly in the older parts of the cities [</span><span class="T23">→</span><a href="Present_eq_Past.html" class="ListLabel_20_130"><span class="Internet_20_link"><span class="T34">Present = Past (Stuck)</span></span></a>]. Therefore, there are only two ways out [</span><span class="T23">→</span><a href="Hope_vs_Hell.html" class="ListLabel_20_117"><span class="Internet_20_link"><span class="T34">Hope <em>vs</em> Hell</span></span></a>]: either leave the country [</span><span class="T23">→</span><a href="Migration.html" class="ListLabel_20_129"><span class="Internet_20_link"><span class="T34">Migration</span></span></a>] or leave the old cities for an essentially different, somehow utopian ground. Who would blame those who choose this option if they have the means to do so? Flowery official propaganda about all kinds of achievements and the nation’s progress notwithstanding [</span><span class="T23">→</span><a href="Voice_from_Above.html" class="ListLabel_20_130"><span class="Internet_20_link"></span></span></a><a href="Voice_from_Above.html" class="ListLabel_20_130"><span class="Internet_20_link"><span class="T34">The Voice from Above</span></span></a>], even the State seems to share the feeling of having reached a dead end and therefore starts to move out itself: On April 27, President al-Sisi inaugurates the new headquarters of the Ministry of Interior in New Cairo (</span><span class="T41">Youssef</span>), a measure that precipitates the complete removal, planned for 2022, of all ministries to the new administrative city—“Sisity”—that is under construction in the Eastern Desert (</span><span class="T41">Amjahid</span>). With this, the government follows dozens of factories that already have their headquarters or major plants in New Cairo (General Electrics, Siemens, El Sewedy Electric), as well as </span>prestigious international schools and colleges which have major campuses here (<span class="T6">NUCA</span>): British International College (BIC), The American International School in Egypt (AIS), the New Cairo British International School (NCBIS), the Lycée Français, and many more. Important universities, too, have moved to, or been newly founded in, New Cairo: The American University (AUC), the German University (GUC), the Future University in Egypt (FUE), the Canadian International College (CIC), the New Cairo Academy.</p><p class="Standard">With the exception perhaps of 6</span><span class="T196">th</span> of October City, earlier projects of satellite cities in the Western and Eastern Deserts which have been promoted ever since Sadat have never been really successful (due to poor planning—scarcity of water!—remoteness, speculation, corruption). New Cairo, by contrast, seems to have the potential of becoming a success story. Although, it is true, the estimated 1.5 million people who are currently living here are far from the 4–5 million for which New Cairo is designed, the area is still attracting more inhabitants, and apartments and villas are “rented out at faster rate in New Cairo than in 6</span><span class="T196">th</span> of October City” (al-</span><span class="T41">Aees</span>). It is no longer only the super-rich who are living here, the compound community has begun to differentiate: alongside with the very luxurious gated communities there are also “moderate, low high and post-enclosed” ones, “based on residents’ economic status” (</span><span class="T41">El Sayed</span>). The area is not connected to the metro system yet; but there is a vast network of bus lines operating between here and other cities in the country (</span><span class="T6">Cairo360, CairoScene</span>), and there are taxis, micro-buses, and even public buses from/to Taḥrīr Sq. (</span><span class="T41">Chiti</span>). It may take some more years for the new districts to further develop their infrastructure, facilities and cultural activities. However, the more people they attract the broader and more varied the spectrum can be expected to become. For the moment, an event like the Book Fair in al-Shaykh Zāyid City (in the Western Desert) is far from able to compete with the traditional big Cairo Book Fair in ʿAbbāsiyya: interesting publishers, yes, but almost no customers, poor infrastructure, everything arranged a bit sloppily and without perceivable commitment, as if the organizers themselves did not believe in the meaningfulness of exhibiting here… (</span><span class="T6">ibid.</span>). However, as polls among the compound dwellers show, many are quite satisfied already now </span><span class="T41">(El Sayed, </span><span class="T6">NUCA</span>)—not to speak of the many </span><span class="T23">→</span><a href="Tourist_Resorts.html" class="ListLabel_20_124"><span class="Internet_20_link"><span class="T34">Tourist Resorts</span></span></a> that are organized as gated communities and where you can find “everything” you may desire “at the seaside” (</span><span class="T6">kulluh ʿa l-baḥr</span>), in immediate vicinity of where you spent your vacation, without having to contact the outside world (</span><span class="T6">The Shore</span>). Moreover, “[i]nvesting in properties within a gated community is one of the most profitable investments in Egypt especially in time of unrest” (</span><span class="T6">ibid.</span>).</span></p><h5
