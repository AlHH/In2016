<p class="FirstNormal">In a cartoon entitled “Contemporary Police,” </span>two police officers contemplate the street before them, which displays the reconstruction of a crime scene (</span><span class="T41">Mohab</span>). Sketched in white chalk on the dark asphalt, the scene ironically represents police brutality. Clearly recognizable by their caps, the white profiles of the two officers, drawn on the ground, hold the blackjacks they used against a harmless man. Some red stains point to bloodshed, suggesting they beat him to death. Contemplating the crime scene, they actually produced, the two officers are perfectly calm. “You seem to be influenced by Keith Haring,” one says to the other, as if appraising a work of art [</span><span class="T23">→</span><a href="Beautiful_vs_Ugly.html" class="ListLabel_20_124"><span class="Internet_20_link"><span class="T34">Beautiful <em>vs</em> Ugly</span></span></a>]. The calm emerging from the cartoon sarcastically points to a bitter reality: police brutality is not an exception in Egypt, but a trivial routine. Another cartoon, drawn by an Italian, closely parallels this view. Following the abduction and murder in Cairo of Italian researcher Giulio Regeni [</span><span class="T23">→</span><a href="Suspect_Foreigner.html" class="ListLabel_20_124"><span class="Internet_20_link"><span class="T34">The Suspect Foreigner</span></span></a>], it portrays a huge stack of young men who have died under torture. In front of it, a high officer of the Egyptian police faces a dilemma: how will he distinguish the Italian body from all the Egyptians who suffered the same treatment? (</span><span class="T41">Natangelo</span>) Widely shared on social media in Egypt, this cartoon is used to oppose the propaganda depicting Regeni as a spy [</span><span class="T23">→</span><a href="True_eq_False.html" class="ListLabel_20_124"><span class="Internet_20_link"><span class="T34">True = False (Conspiracy Theories)</span></span></a>]</span><span class="T96">.</span> According to an anonymous Egyptian source, the chief of Giza Police section, previously accused of having tortured suspects, is behind both the order to abduct Regeni and the narrative portraying him as a threat to Egyptian security (</span><span class="T6">madaMaṣr</span> [b]).</span></p><p class="Standard">Police brutality makes the headlines in connection with the anniversary of the 2011 revolutions in both Egypt and Tunisia, when the comparison between the present and the past emerges with particular strength [</span><span class="T23">→</span><a href="Present_vs_Past.html" class="ListLabel_20_124"><span class="Internet_20_link"><span class="T34">Present <em>vs</em> Past</span></span></a><span class="T96">,</span><span class="T23"> →</span><a href="Commemoration.html" class="ListLabel_20_124"><span class="Internet_20_link"><span class="T34">Commemoration / Memorial Days</span></span></a>]. In Tunisia, the beginning of the new year witnesses the largest wave of social unrest since 2011. While the protests reveal the depth of Tunisia’s unresolved socio-economic crisis characterized by widespread unemployment and deepening social inequality [<span class="T23">→</span><a href="Dollar_Crisis.html class="ListLabel_20_130"><span class="Internet_20_link"><span class="T34">Dollar Crisis</span></span></a><span class="T71">, </span><span class="T23">→</span><a href="Tourist_Resorts.html" class="ListLabel_20_124"><span class="Internet_20_link"><span class="T34">Tourist Resorts</span></span></a><span class="T23">, →</span><a href="Affluence_vs_Destitution.html" class="ListLabel_20_124"><span class="Internet_20_link"><span class="T34">Affluence <em>vs</em> Destitution</span></span></a>]</span>, the police’s harsh response to it exposes “just how little has changed for the better in the relationship between the police and the general public since the 2011 uprising,” as the newspaper </span><span class="T6">al-Ḥayāt </span>comments (</span><span class="T41">Ṣāyigh</span>). Within nine days, more than 1000 people and dozens of activists are arrested, most of whom are accused of having participated in acts of looting, vandalism or even violence against the police. Activists lament the “repression of social movements,” recalling “the old tendencies of a police state,” and even accuse a union of the National Guard of “diffusing fabricated images portraying violent protests” (</span><span class="T41">Chennaoui</span> [a]) [</span><span class="T23">→</span><a href="Prison.html" class="ListLabel_20_124"><span class="Internet_20_link"><span class="T34">Prison</span></span></a><span class="T71">, </span><span class="T23">→</span><a href="True_vs_False.html" class="ListLabel_20_124"><span class="Internet_20_link"><span class="T34">True <em>vs</em> False </span></span></a>, </span><span class="T23">→</span><a href="Security_eq_Fear.html" class="ListLabel_20_124"><span class="Internet_20_link"><span class="T34">Security = Fear (Police State)</span></span></a>]. </span></p><p class="Standard">Meanwhile, in Cairo, </span>cultural centers are shut down and private flats are systematically searched </span>[</span><span class="T77">→</span><a href="Downtown.html" class="ListLabel_20_130"><span class="Internet_20_link"><span class="T34">Downtown</span></span></a>]</span>, as the Egyptian authorities seek to prevent the opposition from marking the anniversary of the 2011 revolution on January 25. A</span>rrests keep increasing in number, targeting w</span>ell-known activists alongside youth who are not politically engaged, but whose activity on social media or gatherings in public places, in a climate of paranoia, arouse suspicion. People are taken from their houses or from cafes and they literally “vanish” (</span><span class="T41">Ismail &amp; Walsh</span>) </span>[</span><span class="T23">→</span><a href="Disappearances.html" class="ListLabel_20_124"><span class="Internet_20_link"><span class="T34">Disappearances</span></span></a>]</span>. D</span>uring a speech at a police college, Egyptian president ʿAbd al-Fattāḥ al-Sīsī advises the Tunisians to protect their country and “not let it go to ruin.” Sīsī’s speech is welcomed by a spokesperson for the Tunisian government who says it has “moved the country’s leaders and people.” However, Tunisian activists on Twitter draw parallels between Sīsī’s comments and those of his predecessor Ḥusnī Mubārak who in 2011 similarly dismissed the unrest in Tunisia that would eventually spread to Egypt and lead to his own demise (</span><span class="T6">Middle East Eye</span>) </span>[</span><span class="T23">→</span><a href="Present_vs_Past.html" class="ListLabel_20_124"><span class="Internet_20_link"><span class="T34">Present <em>vs</em> Past</span></span></a>]</span>. </span></p><p class="Standard">On the other hand, at least in Tunisia, since the ouster of strongman Zayn al-ʿĀbidīn Bin ʿAlī, there are noticeable improvements in police conduct. Rallies and demonstrations without police intervention are a daily scene in the cities, overt police violence in the streets and the use of torture in custody are less frequent (</span><span class="T6">ACAT</span>). Since Bin ʿAlī’s surveillance and censorship apparatus has largely dissipated, activists enjoy an unprecedented level of freedom of expression. However, old habits die hard and torture, although less visible and frequent, is still used in police stations as a tool of interrogation, intimidation or punishment. In July, journalist and activist Hinda al-Shinnāwī published a report on several victims of police torture within only a few weeks. In one case, the police confiscated the goods of an unemployed teacher and father of three who maintained a small tobacco stand to support his family [</span><span class="T23">→</span><a href="System_vs_People.html" class="ListLabel_20_124"><span class="Internet_20_link"><span class="T34">“The System” <em>vs</em> “The People”</span></span></a>]. After the police had refused to return his goods and then abused and humiliated him at the police station, the man immolated himself in front of his perpetrators (</span><span class="T41">Chennaoui</span> [c]). The case is, of course, reminiscent of the iconic “martyr” Muḥammad al-Būʿazīzī, the young street vendor from Sidi Bouzid who in 2010 sparked the Arab Spring when he set himself on fire after the police seized his goods and humiliated him in public [</span><span class="T23">→</span><a href="Present_eq_Past.html" class="ListLabel_20_124"><span class="Internet_20_link"><span class="T34">Present = Past (Stuck)</span></span></a>]. It shows that five years after the revolution, the struggle for a police service that respects human rights has still not produced the desired results. Certainly, important advances have been made on the legal front. Already in 2013, a law was passed that subjects police stations to inspections by human rights monitors. In February, a new law was approved which guarantees the presence of a lawyer during police interrogation and reduces the duration of police custody to 48 hours (</span><span class="T41">Chennaoui</span> [b]). </span></p><p class="Standard">However, according to activists, the Tunisian pre-revolutionary penal code has been amended only gradually and in a piecemeal fashion (</span><span class="T41">Roellin</span>, </span><span class="T6">Notes</span>). Consequently, journalists and activists who are critical of the political system and, especially, the still powerful security sector, continue to be subjected to intimidation and prosecution. The arrest of 17-year-old high-school student and activist of </span><span class="T23">→</span><a href="Manish_Msamih.html" class="ListLabel_20_140"><span class="Internet_20_link"><span class="T34">Mānīsh Msāmiḥ</span></span></a>, ʿAfrā Bin ʿAzzā, is a case in point. In late December 2015, she was charged with defaming police officers in her Facebook posts and, despite being a minor, spent one night in a police station where she was subjected to abusive verbal treatment and sexual harassment (</span><span class="T41">Ben Tarjem</span>). After weeks of public outrage at the judiciary and the police’s inadequate handling of the case, a children’s judge finally dismissed the charge (</span><span class="T6">Tuniscope</span>). The police also use other provisions of the penal code as mere pretexts to harass and imprison critics. In the case of young activists and artists, they often invoke provisions related to violating “public morals” (drunkenness in public, not observing the fast during the month of Ramadan, etc.) and, especially, the uncompromising Law 52 which punishes the consumption of cannabis, locally known as </span><span class="T23">→</span><a href="Zatla.html" class="ListLabel_20_126"><span class="Internet_20_link"><span class="T88">Zaṭla</span></span></a>, with one year in prison and a fine of a thousand dinars. ʿAfrā Bin ʿAzzā, who had already been arrested twice before the above incident, says that when she became engaged in another social movement dubbed </span><span class="T6">Ḥāsibhum</span> (“Hold them accountable”) against police violence and impunity, she already knew she was targeted by the police and “expected to be arrested again” (</span><span class="T41">Ben Tarjem</span>).</span></p><p class="Standard">In the same way, Egyptian authorities do not lack legal tools to pressure young activists and artists. </span>The so-called Blasphemy Law, which punishes offenses against religion, and Article 178 of the Criminal Code, which punishes “violations of public morals” (</span><span class="T6">munāfiyat al-ādāb al-ʿāmma</span>), are vague enough to be applied in a vast range of situations. This gives the authorities room to maneuver against their targets</span>, as the famous case against novelist Aḥmad Nājī, accused of “offending public morals,” incisively illustrates </span>[</span><span class="T23">→</span><a href="Court_Trials.html" class="ListLabel_20_117"><span class="Internet_20_link"><span class="T34">Court Trials</span></span></a>].</span> </span>Nevertheless, the most striking aspect is the frequency of arrests that are not framed within the law, in which no charges are exhibited, and no mention is made of the duration of detention. These arrests, which may also involve teenagers, contribute to blurring the boundaries between police and criminals. In one instance, at least fifteen students whose ages range from 15 to 20 were abducted from their houses in the governorate of Alexandria, some of them along with their younger brothers. The police did not notify any charge, nor give any information on where to find them. In the face of the insistence of the parents, the reply was “you will recover your children in the morgue” (</span><span class="T6">madaMaṣr</span> [</span><span >a]</span>) [</span><span class="T23">→</span><a href="Disappearances.html" class="ListLabel_20_124"><span class="Internet_20_link"><span class="T34">Disappearances</span></span></a>]. </span></p><p class="Standard">Arrests do not only target artists, political opponents or people perceived as such. They can hit anyone, generating fear among citizens who fail to understand the logic behind them. </span>The constant feeling of being under surveillance, followed, and suspect even though one has not committed any crime can also lead to a state of exhaustion and suffocation. The everyday harassments and humiliations practiced by the police in public, especially against young people from marginalized areas, also remain an issue of concern. When young men from the poorer neighborhoods of Tunis or Cairo come to visit the downtown areas of the cities, they are often stopped at certain junctions </span>[</span><span class="T23">→</span><a href="Kamin.html" class="ListLabel_20_140"><span class="Internet_20_link"><span class="T34">Kamīn</span></span></a>;</span><span class="T34"> </span><span class="T23">→</span><a href="Downtown.html" class="ListLabel_20_124"><span class="Internet_20_link"><span class="T34">Downtown / Centre-ville</span></span></a><span class="T96">;</span><span class="T34"> </span><span class="T23">→</span><a href="Centre_vs_Periphery.html" class="ListLabel_20_124"><span class="Internet_20_link"><span class="T34">Centre <em>vs</em> Periphery </span></span></a>]</span>. The police target them on account of their physical appearance, clothing, and dialect, as well as the direction from which they are coming. After rounding up the young men and checking their IDs, which reveal their place of residence and family background, the police decide whether they let them “move along” or proceed to further control measures, often related to alleged drugs or alcohol consumption. Another common scenario for residents of modest or poor neighborhoods is described in a blog published in </span><span class="T6">Nawaat</span>: </span></p><p class="Quote">You may be sitting in peace, sipping coffee, playing cards with some friends or following a sports event.

Typically, smoking a joint or drinking alcohol in public gets young men in trouble. Sometimes, an alleged case of theft, a violent argument between neighbors or the incapability or refusal of a street peddler to give a bribe to the police leads to a conflict with the latter. The ubiquity of seemingly all-powerful policemen—in uniform or without, in cars, on motorcycles or on foot, whether in a coffee shop, in a park or at the stadium—takes a heavy toll on young people who already live under intense economic and social pressure [</span><span class="T23">→</span><a href="Young_vs_Settled.html" class="ListLabel_20_130"><span class="Internet_20_link"><span class="T34">Young <em>vs</em> Settled</span></span></a><span class="T71">; </span><span class="T23">→</span><a href="Affluence_vs_Destitution.html" class="ListLabel_20_124"><span class="Internet_20_link"><span class="T34">Affluence <em>vs</em> Destitution</span></span></a><span class="T71">; </span><span class="T23">→</span><a href="file:///C:/guthst/Dropbox/14%20NFR%20In2016/1804%20Workshop%20Oslo/Apartment_Wanted.html" class="ListLabel_20_130"><span class="Internet_20_link"><span class="T34">Apartment Wanted</span></span></a><span class="T71">].</span> Sometimes, the policeman is described as a cruel elder brother who does not protect his siblings, but rather constantly follows, controls and terrorizes them. This is why, in Tunisian youth slang, the policeman is called </span><span class="T6">al-ḥākim</span><span >,</span> which also means “the ruler” or “the authority” as well as, specifically, “the judge” (</span><span class="T41">Roellin</span>, </span><span class="T6">Notes</span>).

The images or videos are then usually posted on Facebook in the hope of generating mobilization and prompting the authorities to react (</span><span class="T6">Observateurs </span>[b]). One such video shows the violent arrest of a man who apparently has had an altercation with a female car driver over a traffic violation in a Tunis suburb. In the video, the woman punches the man and spits on him while plainclothes policemen prevent the man from defending himself instead of stopping her (</span><span class="T6">Ḥāsibhum</span>). Another Facebook video shows a traffic police officer who extorts a bribe from a man and his mother in a car near Gabès (</span><span class="T6">Asslema FM</span>). We notice that the mother secretly films the scene while she complains: “Why pay forty dinars? That’s too much!” The policeman does not want to negotiate and insists, “Forty dinars, not a cent less, it’s not you who decides.” While the content of the video does not reveal why the car driver was stopped, it is evident that the forty dinars are a bribe since they are demanded immediately, whereas traffic tickets can be paid with a delay. In Tunisia, such widely shared videos revealing police abuse often prompt the Interior Ministry to open an investigation and sometimes even to suspend the perpetrators, as in the latter case (</span><span class="T6">Observateurs</span> [a]). </span></p><p class="Standard"><span >In </span>Egypt, more serious cases of police misconduct come to public attention and create controversy.

Later on, the court of first instance condemns the responsible police officer to eight years in jail (</span><span class="T41">Ghānim</span>), yet similar incidents follow. In the Cairo popular neighborhood of Darb al-Aḥmar, a police officer shoots dead a 24-year-old driver who </span><span >was transporting </span>furniture for him.

In 2023, Egypt is invaded by the Knights of Malta, becoming a portion of their Republic. While the vast majority of Egyptians adjust to the foreign occupation, some police officers join the resistance. They decide to put their expertise with weapons and combat in the service of the Egyptian nation but have to quit the Egyptian police to achieve this goal.
