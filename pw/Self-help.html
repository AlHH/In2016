<p class="FirstNormal">The book that the young fully veiled woman in front of the Cairo Book Fair booth of Alef Publications is interested in is <span class="T6">al-Marǧaʿ al-ʾakīd fī lughat al-ǧasad</span>, an Arabic translation of <span class="T6">The Definitive Book of Body Language</span> by Barbara and Allan Pease (<span class="T41">Bīys &amp; Bīys</span>). Evidently, she wants to learn more about “The Hidden Meaning Behind People’s Gestures and Expressions,” as the subtitle has it. As in bookshops or at street vendors in town, the book is displayed together with others authored by American self-help and personal development gurus like Zig Ziglar, John C. Maxwell, Anthony ‘Tony’ Robbins, Malcolm Gladwell, Marie Kondō, or Steven R. Covey. In addition to body language, they promise to enlighten the reader about “How to Develop Excellence in Yourself and Others” (<span class="T41">Zīglār</span>) and “How to Take Immediate Control of Your Mental, Emotional, Physical and Financial Destiny” (<span class="T41">Rūbīnz</span>); they want to develop in him or her “The Power of Thinking Without Thinking” (<span class="T41">Glādwīl</span>) or to teach him/her “Powerful Lessons in Personal Change” (<span class="T41">Kūfī</span>); others aspire to build “Your Foundation for Successful Leadership” (<span class="T41">Mākswīl</span>) or suggest that “The Japanese Art of Decluttering and Organizing” will change your life (<span class="T41">Kūndū</span>). Although a look into the front matter shows that the English originals of many of these titles date as far back as to the mid-1980s or early 1990s (<span class="T41">Zīglār</span> 1986, <span class="T41">Kūfī</span> 1989,<span class="T41"> Rūbīnz </span>1992) and that also several of the Arabic translations have been on the market since the mid-2000s, obviously they continue to appeal to a wide public and therefore are reprinted again and again.</p><p class="Standard">The unbroken success of such publications seems to be due to the optimism they spread: whereas the overall situation in post-revolutionary Egypt and Tunisia is rather depressing [<span class="T27">→</span><a href="Hope_eq_Hell.html" class="ListLabel_20_270"><span class="Internet_20_link"><span class="T34">Hope = Hell (Dystopia)</span></span></a>, <span class="T23">→</span><a href="Present_eq_Past.html" class="ListLabel_20_296"><span class="Internet_20_link"><span class="T34">Present = Past (Stuck)</span></span></a>], they promise that prosperity and happiness still <span class="T6">are </span>achievable—if not for the country as a whole so at least on a personal level [<span class="T27">→</span><a href="Freedom_vs_Constraint.html" class="ListLabel_20_270"><span class="Internet_20_link"><span class="T34">Freedom <em>vs</em> Constraint</span></span></a>]. Yes, you <span class="T6">can</span><span class="T41"> </span>solve all your problems, regain control of your life and realize most of the dreams everybody has—under one condition however: you have to do something <span class="T6">yourself</span>, have to <span class="T6">work on</span> yourself: “Now [after having read the book] the question is… Do you want to go ahead???!!... Do you want to develop yourself?? […] So, why not start with yourself […]???” (<span class="T41">Muṣṭafà)</span>. And a premise of this is of course that you defy pessimism—don’t allow depression (<span class="T6">iktiʾāb</span>) to take over, it is a negative thought that prevents you from being a winner instead of a loser, a leader instead of a powerless victim. Like an entrepreneur, you should regard your life and your self as a project to be developed:</p><p class="Quote">It is very important in the [life] trajectory of any of us that you stand a while in front of the mirror... the mirror of your self... through which you can see and know it [<span class="T6">sc.</span> the self], and learn from it... in order to [...] start to accept your self and love it, and change it for the better. It is a journey that is worth the fatigue, patience, and pain [that it demands],</p><p class="FirstNormal">claims an advertisement for the year’s most popular self-help book, Dr. Muḥammad Ṭāhā’s <span class="T6">il-Khurūg ʿan il-naṣṣ</span> (Out of the Box). Apart from its contents, it owes its vast popularity to the fact that it is not translated from a foreign work but written by a local, an assistant professor of Psychiatry at Minya University [<span class="T23">→</span><a href="Psychiatrists.html" class="ListLabel_20_270"><span class="Internet_20_link"><span class="T34">Psychiatrists</span></span></a>], and even in the Egyptian vernacular, using easy vocabulary [<span class="T27">→</span><a href="Language.html" class="ListLabel_20_270"><span class="Internet_20_link"><span class="T34">Language</span></span></a>], “to simplify (<span class="T6">tabsīṭ</span>), facilitate (<span class="T6">taysīr</span>) and communicate (<span class="T6">tawṣīl</span>) the deep—and at times complex—psychological ideas and information” (<span class="T41">Ṭāhā</span>). In an almost Calvinistic manner, and with the attitude of teaching a science, these books as well as correspondent TV programs and YouTube videos do not blame the political, economic and social system for people’s unhappiness and failure—the general situation is taken as a given fact—but instead put all responsibility on the individual that has not yet discovered its potential, not yet begun to study itself, or its self, not yet understood that this self can be formed and that you can learn how to be happy and successful.</p><p class="Standard">The underlying concept of a “technology of the self” (<span class="T41">Kenney</span>) comes in several variations, often overlapping, and obviously all equally popular. There is the one designed for the (would-be) entrepreneur, manager, business leader who wants to have a top performance, be effective, efficient, rich, afford himself all the luxury goods and follow the fashions that the global market has to offer. The neoliberal spirit that drives this group is however not restricted to them alone: at the end of the year, also a magazine like <span class="T6">CairoScene </span>crowns their “16 of 2016”—Egypt’s “real influencers” (as the URL condenses the article’s contents), “groundbreakers making a positive impact” (as the header paragraph specifies), “re-design[ers of] the country’s human landscape” (<span class="T41">Hosny</span> &amp; <span class="T41">Primo</span>). It has become fashionable to show such examples of success—look here, the present situation is not as hopeless as you may think, everything can be improved and be fine if only you think “out of the box” and follow these examples.</p><p class="Standard">Critical voices doubt this optimism very much. A cartoon in <span class="T6">MadàMaṣr</span>, titled “Destiny” (<span class="T6">al-Maṣīr</span>), tells a pointed story. Scene 1: a sinking ship. Scene 2: a man who has survived the catastrophe and is now desperately clinging to a plank, drifting in the agitated sea, cries: “Aaaargh! Is this the end?” In this moment, he has a vision (scene 3): the late Ibrāhīm al-Fiqī, a well-known self-help lecturer, smiles at him and assures him: “No! Be optimistic!” (<span class="T6">tafāʾal!</span>). In the next moment, however (scene 4), al-Fiqī himself is devoured by a shark: “Aaaaaaa!”—the drowning man desperately looking on (<span class="T41">Galal</span>).</p><p class="Standard">Al-Fiqī’s books sell well nevertheless, even posthumously. Their topics range from sales techniques to efficient business management, from self-development to overall success. Like his “Pathway to Excellence” (<span class="T6">al-Ṭārīq ilà l-imtiyāz</span>) (<span class="T41">al-Fiqī</span> [a]), also Ṭāhā’s <span class="T6">il-Khurūg ʿan il-naṣṣ</span><span class="T176"> comes as a manual in which the reader is introduced into the “science of happiness” (</span><span class="T45">Kenney</span><span class="T176">) in short, easily digestible chapters, each focussing on one aspect, or step, and giving you very practical advice, taken from everyday life, on what you can and should do. </span><span class="T176">Typically, the authors draw their authority from the fact that they are academics—doctors of psychology, </span><span class="T23">→</span><a href="Psychiatrists.html" class="ListLabel_20_270"><span class="Internet_20_link"><span class="T34">Psychiatrists</span></span></a> (as al-Fiqī and Ṭāhā), or surgeons (as Kīrillus Bahgat).</p><p class="Standard">Those for whom becoming a successful entrepreneur seems to be too high and unrealistic a goal, have their own gurus. Some are not interested in career and success but feel stressed nevertheless by the demands and constraints of their daily lives. They are looking for methods to fulfil the many expectations that they feel are put on them: it is not enough these days, for instance, to just be a caring mother, no, you have to be a “super mummy” (<span class="T41">al-Ǧundī</span>). Others are looking for orientation and advice about “how to control your feelings after a divorce” and are happy to find a booklet that promises to tell them how “to grow wings” again after such an event in one’s life (<span class="T41">ʾUsāma</span>). Yet others seek to reach some peace of mind or to balance the materialism of their hectic consumerist present with contemplation, love, and spiritual values. Still others have their—little or big—projects and dreams and know that in order to achieve these, they can and have to do something themselves: to a large degree, they are responsible for their own happiness or failures, they are themselves the architects of their lives. “My dream is that you don’t wait […] for someone to make your dreams come true,” concludes a booklet that invites you, via exemplary stories, to try to think of “100 Dreams Before You Die” and start to work for their realization (<span class="T41">Galāl</span>). Readers welcome the self-helpers’ experience, their expertise and guidance. They are eager to read, for instance, that according to Muḥammad Ṭāhā there are two main things most people have to learn: to know themselves and to live themselves. Therefore, the “doctor” advises, or admonishes, you to “get up [and] check your limits” (<span class="T41">Ṭāhā</span>, chapter 1), learn to discern “your real self [from] your false self” (chapter 2) [<span class="T27">→</span><a href="Dual_Identities.html" class="ListLabel_20_270"><span class="Internet_20_link"><span class="T34">Dual Identities / Masking</span></span></a><span class="T176">] and your true, authentic feelings from those that “are not really your feelings” (chapter 5); be aware that your feelings often simply conform to conventions or to what others expect of you, so always try to think “Out of the box” (chapter 8) and beware of “Dangerous relationships” (chapter 6), especially those that impede the sound development and free unfolding of a strong, self-conscious, self-confident personality by threatening you with “the strongest weapon in the history of mankind”—guilt (chapter 13), guilt that is felt, often excessively, due to your upbringing [</span><span class="T23">→</span><a href="Father_Figures.html" class="ListLabel_20_270"><span class="Internet_20_link"><span class="T34">Father Figures</span></span></a>] and the norms that society or religion—may it speak through a Muslim <span class="T6">shaykh</span><span class="T176"> [</span><span class="T28">→</span><a href="In_Islam.html" class="ListLabel_20_270"><span class="Internet_20_link"><span class="T34">In Islam, …</span></span></a>] or a Christian <span class="T6">kāhin</span> (priest)—want you to obey to; you have to learn to overcome this because the feeling of guilt “will stop you, imprison you, paralyze you, and it will make you repeat the same mistake again” (<span class="T7">ibid</span>.).</p><p class="Standard">Easily comprehensible language, illustration with concrete situations from everyday life, and examples of successfully completed personal development and mastered challenges are as important here as they are in the books on business management and leadership. Although some readers feel disappointed to a certain degree—for them, Dr. Ṭāhā’s approach is too simplistic, too popular; an academic should go deeper, be less repetitive, elaborate more on details—, most agree nevertheless that the psychologist addresses</p><p class="Quote">important psychological needs and problems that everybody has, and it makes you face these things, and suggests solutions; the author shows you aspects of your personality that you haven’t known about so far; you have to read it slowly, for although it is small in size you can benefit a lot,</p><p class="FirstNormal">writes for instance a certain “zahraa esmaile” in her comment on <span class="T6">il-Khurūg ʿan il-naṣṣ</span> on GoodReads (<span class="T7">Good Reads</span>). As to the question whether or not the vernacular is the adequate language to convey such messages and popularize psychological-psychiatric knowledge, the readership is divided: some find it strange (<span class="T7">ibid</span>.), some surprising, or are even “put off” (<span class="T7">ibid</span>.), some would have preferred a mixed style [<span class="T27">→</span><a href="Language.html" class="ListLabel_20_270"><span class="Internet_20_link"><span class="T34">Language</span></span></a>].</p><p class="Standard">The majority of those who comment on Ṭāhā’s book on GoodReads and those who attend the many book signing events of self-helpers seem to be women—perhaps because the pressure on women in general is higher than on men, suggests Dīnā Ibrāhīm Shaʿbān, author of <span class="T6">Mudhakkirāt Ǧamīla Saʿīd</span> (The Memoirs of J.S.—the name translates as “Beauty,” the surname as “Happy”), a novel that narrates the story of the successful fight of the female protagonist to live her own self. As if to underline the heroine’s difficult starting position, “Beauty” is described as very ugly...</p><p class="Standard">The obstacles Shaʿbān, Ṭāhā and others show as working against self-exploration, self-finding, and self-fulfilment are many. One of the most powerful and difficult to resist under the present circumstances is the temptation to give oneself to passive despair or depression [<span class="T27">→</span><a href="Hope_vs_Hell.html" class="ListLabel_20_270"><span class="Internet_20_link"><span class="T34">Hope <em>vs</em> Hell</span></span></a>]. Those who manage to overcome <span class="T6">iktiʾāb</span> often become the heroes and heroines not only of self-help books but also of documentaries about dealing with trauma (like <span class="T6">Jeanne d’Arc Masriya</span>) or even, in satirical exaggeration, of comedies: Ibrāhīm, one of the protagonists of <span class="T6">ʿAlī Miʿza wa-Ibrāhīm</span>, who suffers from a specific imagined noise haunting him every now and then, succeeds in healing himself by constantly searching for the one sound that was responsible for his trauma; in the end, he can even transform into a superman who turns this terrible sound into a weapon to fight his and his friends’ enemy.</p><p class="Standard">Next to <span class="T6">iktiʾāb</span> comes self-delusion. This is to be fought by minute self-exploration and absolute truthfulness to yourself—and perhaps also a good portion of self-irony, as Kīrillus Bahgat’s “The Intellectual Experience of Mama’s Boy” <span class="T6">(il-Tagriba il-fikriyya li-rūḥ ʾummuh)</span>, Haytham Muṣṭafà’s <span class="T6">Ikbis-hā bunn</span> (“Press ground coffee on it [sc. the wound (to stop it from bleeding)]”)<span class="T6"> </span>or ʾĪhāb Māǧid’s “For the Losers and Good-for-Nothings” (<span class="T6">Lil-Mawkūs wi-khāyib il-ragā</span>) show, self-help books that clothe their messages in the garments of the popular <span class="T6">sākhir</span><span class="T176"> style (</span><span class="T41">Bahgat</span>, <span class="T41">Muṣṭafà</span>, <span class="T41">Māǧid</span><span class="T176">) [</span><span class="T28">→</span><a href="Inferiority_eq_Superiority.html" class="ListLabel_20_269"><span class="Internet_20_link"><span class="T34">Inferiority = Superiority (Irony)</span></span></a><span class="T176">]. Most self-help books also warn against a lack of steadfastness and suggest as a remedy a sober, realistic analysis not only of yourself but also of your immediate environment—family, friends, colleagues, all may work against you because they represent the demands of society and put the individual under all kinds of constraint and moral pressure [</span><span class="T28">→</span><a href="Freedom_vs_Constraint.html" class="ListLabel_20_270"><span class="Internet_20_link"><span class="T34">Freedom <em>vs</em> Constraint</span></span></a>]:</p><p class="Quote">The problem […] is that your life is a collective property <span class="T6">(milk al-ǧamīʿ)</span>. People decide about it as if it were their own life. They decide about your destiny. Your happiness... your marriage... your work... the number of your children. (<span class="T41">Shaʿbān</span>)</p><p class="Quote">There are people who want to suck all blood out of you, take as much out of you as they can get. And you will always be the giving one. Give, give, give—and lose your blood: you love, accept, allow, listen and understand, pardon, bear... and day by day cut a piece from yourself, offering it as a sacrifice to these people. Every day you pay a high price to please them. And they can’t get enough. Never. (<span class="T7">GoodReads</span>)</p><p class="FirstNormal">Therefore, you have to learn to say “no”:</p><p class="Quote">Against whom are you allowed to put up limits? Where would these be? When? What is important that your limits are clear, and your territory remains safe. And it is important that you defend it and protect it. Against any harm whatsoever. To define the distance between you and any other person is a basic right you have, and which also others have. Your own psychological home is your property, not anybody else’s. (<span class="T7">ibid</span>.)</p><p class="Standard">And novels that aspire to tell exemplary stories of successful emancipation, like <span class="T6">The Memoirs of Ǧamīla Saʿīd</span>, indulge in enacting scenes of resistance: after having described how everybody tries to force Ǧamīla into an arranged marriage, the protagonist asserts herself by repeating, over almost three pages, her no, “I will not get married through a traditional marriage, not even if…,” culminating in “… not even if I were the last hope for the survival of the human race” (<span class="T41">Shaʿbān</span>).</p><p class="Standard">In its demanding and exhausting fight for and defense of itself, the emancipating self-developing individual will not only welcome guidance from the self-help gurus, but also any serious emotional support from others. The best way to get this support, according to Muḥammad Ṭāhā, is—a relationship!</p><p class="Quote">Yes, a relationship. A truly human relationship, one that sends out messages that are different from all those false messages that reached you before via education and learning [...] A relationship in which you will experience unconditional love, a deep and stable, lasting love that does not change irrespective of the changes you go through. […] A relationship in which you will feel accepted as a whole, as you are, with all your parts: your weak and impotent moments, sometimes failures […]. A relationship in which there is space for freedom and motion, not constraint, suffocation, distortion, fake feelings. This relationship can be a friendship, or it can be love/marriage, but it may also be a relationship of (professional) caring in the framework of a psychological treatment. […] Is there such a relationship in your life? [No?] So search for it and keep hold of it. Quickly! And until the end of your life. Because this is the way. This is the solution. This is the answer.</p><p class="Standard">With this advice, Ṭāhā sends out a message that is similar to that of <span class="T6">Hībtā </span><span class="T176">(Hepta), one of the year’s blockbusters that encourages people to fall in love, against all odds [</span><span class="T28">→</span><a href="Beautiful_vs_Ugly.html" class="ListLabel_20_270"><span class="Internet_20_link"><span class="T34">Beautiful <em>vs</em> Ugly</span></span></a>]. Reactions, too, are similar: While many readers of <span class="T6">il-Khurūg </span>find Ṭāhā convincing and Andeel holds that <span class="T6">Hepta</span>’s romantic optimism, on the one hand, serves an important task in a depressing world, on the other hand he warns from falling prey to one’s longing for emotional support and fulfilment (<span class="T41">Andeel</span>), and a number of comments on <span class="T6">il-Khurūg </span>doubt very much that love can “do miracles” (<span class="T7">GoodReads</span>).</p><p class="Standard">Critical voices do not stop at this point. They notice that the self-helpers, while inviting to think “out of the box” and act “against all odds,” actually are much less individualistic and unconventional than the majority of their readers and viewers obviously believe. “I think it’s a superficial book, deserves only 1 star,” writes a certain Hala in her comment on <span class="T6">il-Khurūg</span> (<span class="T7">ibid</span>.) and a Samar Muḥammad confesses to be disappointed because, in reality, for her nothing in the book is genuinely “out of the box” at all—rather, the texts come close to “Facebook postings” (<span class="T7">ibid</span>.), void formula that can be filled with whatever the individual reader may find to make sense for him/her, and while the advice offered in the books may help to develop a certain self-confidence, all blame is put on the individual and his/her assumed adversaries; there is no questioning of the general misery and crisis and who might be responsible for <span class="T6">that</span>. Yet, the books are widely read and the TV programs eagerly watched: the commonplaces are taken for wisdom and broad experience, and the fact that most self-helpers draw on all kinds of sources to support their argument—Islamic, Christian, Buddhistic, Gandhi, Bo Derek, Charlie Chaplin, Saʿd Zaghlūl… “I believe it is possible to learn anything, from anyone, anywhere,” the late Dr. al-Fiqī used to say—, is not taken as illegitimate randomness but as proof of general validity (<span class="T41">al-Fiqī </span>[b]).</p><p class="Standard">Thus, the approaches of these—mainly secularist—self-helpers are hardly more individualistic and unconventional than their Islamic counterparts which mostly (though not exclusively) refer to Islamic sources for textual support and, though often coming with fresh and “daring,” unorthodox, out-of-the-box interpretations, usually do not preach opposition to tradition but rather methods of smooth accommodation to it. A prototype of such young and smart Islamic self-help gurus is the dynamic TV imam Ḥātim al-Shinnāwī, called <span class="T6">“Mawlānā” </span>(Our Master), in Magdī Aḥmad ʿAlī’s movie with the same title. Good-looking (and therefore especially liked by women), always smiling, always witty, the protagonist of the TV show <span class="T6">Ifham dīnak</span> (Understand your religion!) has no problems to justify, on a question from the audience, his own “effeminate” make-up with a reference to the Prophet’s <span class="T6">sunna</span> or to declare that the Prophet, had he lived today, would without doubt have allowed himself and his companions to drive a Mercedes. Imam Ḥātim may have been modelled after the “real” 37-year-old Muṣṭafà Ḥusnī who in many respects seems to have taken the late Ibrāhīm al-Fiqī’s place. Muṣṭafà Ḥusnī<span class="T250"> is a well-known preacher who delivers weekly sermons and lessons at several big mosques in Greater Cairo, has made himself a name as an energetic member of charitable organizations combating drug addiction and </span>propagating<span class="T250"> blood donation for children, and is also remembered for his “A Life Without Smoking” campaign. Mostly, however, his fame rests on the many highly popular books he has written, as well as on dozens of “young Islamic” radio and TV </span>programs that combine televangelism with personality building. Their titles show not only an orientation towards God (<span class="T251">Nidāʾ al-raḥmān</span><span class="T250"> “The Call of the Most Gracious,” </span><span class="T251">ʾUḥibbuka rabbī</span><span class="T250"> “I love you, my Lord”</span>), but also—and perhaps even more—to life in This world: <span class="T250">“The Best (most beautiful) Life” (</span><span class="T251">Aḥlà ḥayāt</span><span class="T250">), “The School of Love” (</span><span class="T251">Madrasat al-ḥubb</span><span class="T250">), “The Charm of This World” (</span><span class="T251">Siḥr al-dunyā</span><span class="T250">), “A New Human Being” (</span><span class="T251">Insān ǧadīd</span><span class="T250">). The same combination is repeated also in Ramaḍān: While a program on </span>Radio 90.90 FM is called <span class="T6">ʿĀʾid ʾīlà llāh</span> “Returning to God,” another one, on TV, is dedicated to “The Art of Life” (<span class="T251">Fann al-ḥayāh</span><span class="T250">). His books are on display everywhere, in new printings, at the Cairo Book Fair, particularly </span><span class="T251">ʿĪsh il-laḥẓa</span><span class="T250"> (Live the Moment), a reprint from last year’s edition, which in its turn was made from a successful TV program with the same title, broadcast in 2014. “Our life is nothing but a number of moments that keep changing us day by day. So, always be with God and live the moment as God wants you to live it,” is the frame under which moments of “Love between husband and wife” are treated as well as instants of “Sadness,” “Despair,” or “Longing for Disobedience/Sin (</span><span class="T251">maʿṣiya</span><span class="T250">)” (</span><span class="T70">Ḥusnī</span><span class="T250">)</span></p><h5 class="Heading_20_5"><a id="a__Related_Entries"><span/></a>Related Entries</h5><p class="Hanging"><span class="T104">Arrays – </span><a href="Dual_Identities.html" class="ListLabel_20_261"><span class="Internet_20_link">Dual Identities / Masking</span></a><span class="T106"> </span><span class="T107">⧫</span><span class="T106"> </span><a href="Father_Figures.html" class="ListLabel_20_261"><span class="Internet_20_link">Father Figures</span></a><span class="T106"> </span><span class="T107">⧫</span><span class="T106"> </span><a href="In_Islam.html" class="ListLabel_20_261"><span class="Internet_20_link">In Islam, …</span></a><span class="T106"> </span><span class="T107">⧫</span><span class="T106"> </span><a href="Language.html" class="ListLabel_20_261"><span class="Internet_20_link">Language</span></a><span class="T106"> </span><span class="T107">⧫</span><span class="T106"> </span><a href="Psychiatrists.html" class="ListLabel_20_261"><span class="Internet_20_link">Psychiatrists</span></a></p><p class="Hanging"><span class="T104">Codes – </span><a href="Beautiful_vs_Ugly.html" class="ListLabel_20_300"><span class="Internet_20_link"><span class="T180">Beautiful <em>vs</em> Ugly</span></span></a><span class="T106"> </span><span class="T107">⧫</span><span class="T106"> </span><a href="Freedom_vs_Constraint.html" class="ListLabel_20_300"><span class="Internet_20_link"><span class="T180">Freedom <em>vs</em> Constraint</span> </span></a><span class="T107">⧫</span><span class="T106"> </span><a href="Hope_vs_Hell.html" class="ListLabel_20_300"><span class="Internet_20_link"><span class="T180">Hope <em>vs</em> Hell </span></span></a></p><p class="Hanging"><span class="T104">Codes Collapsed – </span><a href="Hope_eq_Hell.html" class="ListLabel_20_286"><span class="Internet_20_link"><span class="T82">Hope = Hell (Dystopia)</span></span></a> <span class="T107">⧫</span><span class="T106"> </span><a href="Inferiority_eq_Superiority.html" class="ListLabel_20_286"><span class="Internet_20_link"><span class="T82">Inferiority = Superiority (Irony)</span></span></a> <span class="T107">⧫</span><span class="T106"> </span><a href="Present_eq_Past.html" class="ListLabel_20_352"><span class="Internet_20_link"><span class="T122">Present = Past (Stuck)</span></span></a></p><h5 class="Heading_20_5"><a id="a__References"><span/></a>References</h5><h6 class="Heading_20_6"><a id="a__Written_Sources"><span/></a>Written Sources</h6><p class="Hanging"><span class="T41">Andeel</span> (Andīl). 2016. “Hepta: Do you need to learn how to love?” <span class="T6">MadàMaṣr</span>, April 29, &lt;https://www.madamasr.com/en/2016/04/29/feature/culture/hepta-do-you-need-to-learn-how-to-love/&gt; (as of Apr. 29, 2016) /<span class="T218"> “Hībtā: Muḥāḍarat ‘al-muḥn’.” </span><span class="T219">Ibid.</span><span class="T218">, May 3, &lt;https://www.madamasr.com/ar/2016/05/03/feature/ثقافة/هيبتا-محاضرة-المُحن/&gt; (as of Apr. 11, 2018).</span></p><p class="Hanging"><span class="T41">Bahgat</span>, Kīrillus.
