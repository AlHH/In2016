<!-- EDITOR: PASTE ARTICLE HERE -->
          
<p class="FirstNormal">On February 1, pop star legend Amr Diab (<span class="FirstNormal">ʿAmr Diyāb)</span><span class="T219"> </span>releases the <span class="T218">music</span> video of his latest song on his YouTube channel. <span class="T17">Al-Qāhira</span> (“Cairo”), a collaboration between himself and another beloved Egyptian artist, Mohamed Mounir (Muḥammad Munīr), is to no one’s surprise an instant hit. The video’s opening scene shows Diab standing on the rooftop of the Nile Hilton, a five-star hotel located in the heart of Cairo [<span class="T101">→</span><a href="Downtown.html" class="ListLabel_20_255"><span class="Internet_20_link"><span class="T34">Downtown / Centre-ville</span></span></a>]. He is gazing over the Nile, soaking in the city view as the sun is about to set, seemingly in awe of its beauty. He turns towards the camera and the song starts:</p><p class="Quote">It is like a beautiful girl calling for you. It has a secret that makes it always beautiful in your eyes. How magical she is! I adore her. I love her (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lixPaFt3VV0" class="ListLabel_20_279"><span class="Internet_20_link"><span class="T17">YT</span> “Al-Qāhira”</span></a>).</p><p class="FirstNormal">The band accompanying him includes many traditional Arabic instruments as well as an electric guitar, mixing traditional <span class="T218">music</span> with <span class="T41">western</span> sound elements, a proven Diab-recipe for a successful pop song. In the middle of the video a smiling Mounir enters as he joins in on the chorus. The pair of them look as if they are sitting at a café discussing a beautiful girl. The scenery matches the lyrics perfectly as they go on singing about Cairo’s secret stories, her beauty and long nights (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lixPaFt3VV0" class="ListLabel_20_279"><span class="Internet_20_link"><span class="T17">YT</span> “Al-Qāhira”</span></a>). </p><p class="Standard">The song is essentially a love declaration to Egypt’s capital and generates lots of enthusiastic greetings in the commentary field, from all over the Middle East. However, there is a split in public opinion as many seem to disagree with this romanticized depiction of Cairo, especially in these challenging times [<span class="T101">→</span><a href="Beautiful_vs_Ugly.html" class="ListLabel_20_253"><span class="Internet_20_link"><span class="T34">Beautiful <em>vs</em> Ugly</span></span></a>]. In her article “This is NOT Egypt,” published two weeks after the video is released, Sonia Farid writes:</p><p class="Quote">While the song scored thousands of views immediately after its release and was the most shared and trending on the day it was posted online, it did not receive a warm welcome from a sizeable segment of Egyptians, who wondered whose Cairo the song featured. (<a href="https://english.alarabiya.net/en/2016/02/15/-Thisis-NOT-Egypt-Tourism-campaign-and-song-angers-many.html" class="ListLabel_20_282"><span class="Internet_20_link"><span class="T41">Farid</span></span></a>)</p><p class="FirstNormal">Farid compares the critical reactions to <span class="T17">Al-Qahira</span> to the negative response of the “This is Egypt” campaign, launched by the Egyptian Tourism Authority three months earlier (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3KqP69xuPc" class="ListLabel_20_279"><span class="Internet_20_link"><span class="T17">YT</span> “This Is Egypt”</span></a>) <span class="T218">[</span><span class="T101">→</span><a href="Voice_from_Above.html" class="ListLabel_20_255"><span class="Internet_20_link">The <span class="T34">Voice from Above</span></span></a>]. Both videos present a picture-perfect Egypt: carefree people enjoying themselves on sandy beaches under blue skies, or on top of fancy buildings in a perfect sunset, with no sign of pollution, poverty or garbage in sight [<span class="T101">→</span><a href="Garbage.html" class="ListLabel_20_255"><span class="Internet_20_link"><span class="T34">Garbage</span></span></a>]. Some describe the <span class="T17">Al-Qahira</span> video as “classist”, asking why they didn’t shoot it by the Nile in a more working-class neighbourhood, rather than from above in one of Cairo’s most luxurious hotels. Journalist Liza Dunham comments on the <span class="T6">#This is Egypt</span> video, wondering how many hours it took the producers to Photoshop the pollution out of the colours. Yet others strike back against the critics asking them if they would rather prefer to show only the negative aspects of Egypt, such as the slums and garbage (<a href="https://english.alarabiya.net/en/2016/02/15/-Thisis-NOT-Egypt-Tourism-campaign-and-song-angers-many.html" class="ListLabel_20_282"><span class="Internet_20_link"><span class="T41">Farid</span></span></a>)<span class="T34"> </span><span class="T342">[</span><span class="T101">→</span><a href="Beautiful_vs_Ugly.html" class="ListLabel_20_253"><span class="Internet_20_link"><span class="T34">Beautiful <em>vs</em> Ugly</span></span></a><span class="T342">,</span><span class="T34"> </span><span class="T101">→</span><a href="Affluence_vs_Destitution.html" class="ListLabel_20_250"><span class="Internet_20_link"><span class="T34">Affluence <em>vs</em> Destitution </span></span></a><span class="T220">]</span><span class="T218">. </span></p><p class="Standard">Either way, there is probably no one better to promote a glossy image of Cairo’s beauty than Amr Diab, still going strong in 2016 as the biggest Egyptian pop idol for more than three decades. Well into his fifties now, judging by his recent album covers, he arguably looks closer to thirty. His <span class="T218">music</span>al career continues to bring highlights and later this year he finally receives a Guinness World Record for holding the record for winning the most World <span class="T218">Music</span> Awards for ‘Best Selling Middle Eastern Artist’ (<a href="http://cairoscene.com/Buzz/Amr-Diab-is-Officially-a-Guinness-World-Record-Winner" class="ListLabel_20_279"><span class="Internet_20_link"><span class="T17">cairoSCENE </span>[a]</span></a>). (Some also claim he should win an additional award for “the least aging man.”) His response on Twitter is: “I am very proud to be the first Arab singer to achieve a </span><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/guinessworldrecord?src=hash" class="ListLabel_20_283">#guinessworldrecord</span></span></a><span class="T224"> title. Thank you </span><a href="https://twitter.com/GWR" class="ListLabel_20_283"><span class="Internet_20_link">@GWR</span></span></a>” (<a href="https://twitter.com/amrdiab?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E781097910545121280&amp;ref_url=http%3A%2F%2Fcairoscene.com%2FBuzz%2FAmr-Diab-is-Officially-a-Guinness-World-Record-Winner" class="ListLabel_20_281"><span class="Internet_20_link"><span class="T17">@amrdiab</span></span></a>). </p><p class="Standard">The industry is also taking its toll on some of the most prominent artists. In the end of February, number one female voice in Egypt, Sherine Abdel Wahab (Shīrīn </span><span class="T343">ʿAbd al-Wahhāb)</span>, announces her retirement after sixteen years in the limelight (</span><a href="http://hotarabicMusic.com/2016/02/report-diva-sherine-to-retire-and-quit-the-Music-biz/" class="ListLabel_20_285"><span class="Internet_20_link"><span class="T17">HotArabicMusic</span></span></a>).

In contrast to more typical pop songs, mostly restricted to romance and clichés, the younger generation seems to represent a broader definition of what is considered popular </span><span class="T218">music</span>. As a result, what used to be strictly underground genres are becoming increasingly more mainstream, and in some cases even producing pop stars. A good example of this phenomenon is the relatively newborn genre </span><span class="T6">mahragānāt</span>.

This popularity is also mirrored in the movie <span class="T17">Ishtibāk</span> (Clash): a group of people, representing different parts of Egyptian society, are trapped in a police van with tension running high. Among them is a <span class="T17">shābb</span> who calls himself “DJ Mans.” He uses the opportunity while the group is circulating in front of the van’s backdoor, gasping for fresh air, to pass out his card and promote his DJ business <span class="T6">[</span><span class="T101">→</span><a href="Clash.html" class="ListLabel_20_255"><span class="Internet_20_link"><span class="T34">Clash</span></span></a>] — an allusion to the fact that the <span class="T17">mahragānāt</span> genre is in the process of professionalizing and some actors in the scene have a strong wish to make it in the business. </p><p class="Standard">Dancing is also a vital element of <span class="T17">mahragānāt</span> <span class="T218">music</span> and the genre has created a particular dancing style, mixing traditional moves with influence from western styles such as trance dance [<span class="T343">→</span><a href="Dancing.html" class="ListLabel_20_275"><span class="Internet_20_link"><span class="T34">Dancing</span></span></a>]. The result is a series of intense and fast beat, freestyle moves. On YouTube there are various videos showing people from all ages dancing to <span class="T17">mahragānāt</span>—from youth at a local wedding to old men dancing in the street (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnPDpT-Qri4" class="ListLabel_20_279"><span class="Internet_20_link"><span class="T6">YT</span> “Egyptian dancing on the popular song 2016”</span></a>). The dance factor is huge and has even brought the <span class="T218">music</span> to the Egyptian elite. Occasionally, and mainly at wedding celebrations, they too enjoy the “poor man’s <span class="T218">music</span>,” a phenomenon long-time researcher of the genre, Ferida Jawad, refers to as “the upper class going gangsta for an evening.” However, their choice of <span class="T17">mahragānāt</span> performers is quite exclusive and includes only the most popular artists, such as Oka and Ortega or El Madfaagiya, who is performing at the Vodaphone IN Tour Cairo this year (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XR63CqM2Nc" class="ListLabel_20_279"><span class="Internet_20_link"><span class="T6">YT</span> “IN Tour Cairo</span></a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XR63CqM2Nc" class="ListLabel_20_279"><span class="Internet_20_link">”</span></a>). Even though these artists are more or less embraced by the elite and considered pop stars by now, the public is still generally sceptical towards <span class="T17">mahragānāt</span> <span class="T218">music</span> and the artists behind it. Thus the gap between well established artists and new young independent artists is very evident <span class="T343">[</span><span class="T41">→</span><a href="Young_vs_Settled.html" class="ListLabel_20_250"><span class="Internet_20_link"><span class="T34">Young <em>vs</em> Settled</span></span></a><span class="T343">]</span>. </p><p class="Standard">Apart from mere preference and public opinion, new genres within popular <span class="T218">music</span>, such as <span class="T17">mahragānāt, </span>seem to be further impacted by politics.

Judging by this myriad, it is not only the music scene itself that is evolving, but also the female aspect of it.</span> </span>Included in the <span class="T6">cairoSCENE</span> list is artist and known actress Amina Khalil (Amīna Khalīl). She is recently featured on the big hit “<span class="T6">Nour</span>” together with post-revolutionary rapper Zap Tharwat, described by some as the voice of young Egyptians. “<span class="T6">Nour”</span> tells the story of the elder brother of three siblings, a hard worker who becomes the head of the family as his dad suddenly falls ill. With the new responsibility, Nour takes on a job in the father’s car shop, while still continuing his studies. He finally graduates, and when the time comes to apply for a job the surprise element in the song is revealed: Nour is not the responsible big <span class="T17">brother</span> of a family, but the elder <span class="T17">sister</span> of three girls. The music video shows the employer who is obviously shocked to see a female Nour entering with a bright smile. After battling the prejudices racing in his mind, he finally realizes how influenced he is by society’s limiting gender perceptions and offers Nour the position after all.

The song’s theme is significant as it covers several pressing issues: the economic challenges faced by the majority of Egyptians mixed with very high unemployment rates, especially among the younger generation, and finally the social issue regarding gender stereotypes and restrictions on women’s role in society. </p><p class="Standard">In Tunisia, artists like ‘Medusa’ Boutheina El Aloudi are also challenging societal norms, representing women in hip hop with a feminist perspective: a role that according to El Aloudi herself has not always been easy: “[As a female rapper], I was frequently faced with sexual harassment at shows, events [et cetera]. But I don’t want to generalize, out of respect for those who don’t do it.” In the same interview she also explains how there used to be more girls in the Tunisian hip hop scene, but they are now silencing themselves (<a href="https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/women-hip-hop-making-space-tunisias-unseen-queens" class="ListLabel_20_282"><span class="Internet_20_link"><span class="T41">Djilali</span></span></a>). Most female artists are working abroad these days, and El-Aloudi hopes to see new girls following her lead. Luckily, there are still a few, such as Nour Ben Soltan, a seventeen-year-old B-girl who started her career dancing in community centres and poor neighbourhoods. Since then she has moved on to participate and compete in multiple events and festivals in Tunisia, like the <span class="T6">Beat the Beat</span> Festival in Sousse where she won against contestant Rana et Norhene. Facing the controversy of being a female break-dancer, Ben Soltan’s secret lies in her attitude:</p><p class="Quote">How I am perceived by society is my least concern, so long as I can pursue my passion and excel at what I do. It’s a question of knowing what you want and at the same time [not succumbing to] the pressure of others. (<a href="https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/women-hip-hop-making-space-tunisias-unseen-queens" class="ListLabel_20_282"><span class="Internet_20_link"><span class="T41">Djilali</span></span></a>) <span class="FirstNormal">[</span><span class="T101">→</span><a href="Freedom_vs_Constraint.html" class="ListLabel_20_255"><span class="Internet_20_link"><span class="T34">Freedom <em>vs</em> Constraint</span></span></a><span class="FirstNormal">]</span></p><p class="Standard">Whether it is pulsating electronic beats at festive occasions, provoking lyrical content or female hip hoppers challenging gender stereotypes, music and dancing arguably take on an essential role as a means of expression. In the movie <span class="T6">Sheikh Jackson</span><span class="FirstNormal">, </span>for example, protagonist Khaled (Khālid)’s love for Michael Jackson is what wakes him up and saves him from a state of depression and zombie-like behaviour (<span class="T6">Sheikh Jackson</span>). While trying his best to be pious and stay focused on his role as an Islamic cleric, Khaled starts to remember glimpses of his youth [<span class="T101">→</span><a href="In_Islam.html" class="ListLabel_20_255"><span class="Internet_20_link"><span class="T34">In Islam, …</span></span></a>]. Painful memories occur of a troubled upbringing and a strict and violent father, mixed with the longing for his high school crush. The movie depicts how music was his greatest passion and the only means of opposition, however implicit, to his authoritarian father [<span class="T101">→</span><a href="Father_Figures.html" class="ListLabel_20_250"><span class="Internet_20_link"><span class="T34">Father Figures</span></span></a>]. Later in life, the news of his pop idol’s death triggers repressed feelings, kick-starting an emotional process that makes him able to let go, as he eventually makes peace with his father and his past. In this context music works as an antidote to piety and authority, and thereby serves an important role as a counterpart to the gloomy and grave circumstances Khaled finds himself in. Here, pop music is not seen merely as a shallow form of entertainment ‘ignoring’ more serious problems, but as a sweet and soothing remedy for these very same issues. A parallel can be drawn to musical representation in the movie Clash. In one of the most intense scenes, DJ Mans sits down pressing his phone to his ear with the <span class="T6">mahragānāt</span> song “Haty Bousa ya Bet” (<span class="T6">hātī būsa yā bitt</span> ‘Give me a kiss, girl’) playing, while desperately trying to block out the chaos surrounding him [<span class="T101">→</span><a href="Mobile_Phones.html" class="ListLabel_20_250"><span class="Internet_20_link"><span class="T34">Mobile Phones</span></span></a><span class="T41">]</span>. The music seems to offer DJ Mans some comfort or relief, however small, to the very serious and suffocating situation he is in [<span class="T101">→</span><a href="Hope_vs_Hell.html" class="ListLabel_20_255"><span class="Internet_20_link"><span class="T34">Hope <em>vs</em>  Hell</span></span></a>]. The lively and playful atmosphere of the <span class="T218">music</span> is portrayed as a protecting shield against the harsh reality out there. </p><p class="Standard">Pop music’s role appears to be multifaceted. One aspect concerns the need for a reality check and</span> a demand for more alternative music tackling social issues, such as gender equality and everyday struggles of poor urban youth. Another one concerns the craving for catchy and dancy music as a remedy during challenging times. Popular songs and dancing work as tools to express both joy and frustration: “Al-Qahira” celebrates Cairo and its beauty while “Mafīsh ṣāḥib yitṣāḥib” addresses the hardship in its slums. Both perspectives are arguably relevant in today’s climate. Commenting on “Al-Qahira” (whose lyrics he wrote) in the aftermath of the debate it triggered, Tamer Hussein says:</p><p class="Quote">The fact that the video was praised by some and criticized by others proves how rich and diverse Cairo is, for it can be seen in a thousand different ways.
