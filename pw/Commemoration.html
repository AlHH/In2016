<p class="FirstNormal">“It’s almost like the 7<span class="T196">th</span> of November under Ben Ali (Bin ʿAlī),” notes a young informant, describing the atmosphere on Bourguiba avenue on January 14,<a href="https://nawaat.org/portail/2016/01/17/in-tunis-demonstrators-are-still-chanting-the-slogans-of-the-revolution/" class="ListLabel_20_259"> </a>vividly recreated in the virtual pages of <a href="https://nawaat.org/portail/2016/01/17/in-tunis-demonstrators-are-still-chanting-the-slogans-of-the-revolution/" class="ListLabel_20_307"><span class="T6">Nawaat</span></a>. Music is blasting from loudspeakers, the Tunisian flag proudly displayed on a massive screen. Thousands of people are slowly making their way through the crowds gathered in the centre of the Tunisian capital [<span class="T23">→</span><a href="Downtown.html" class="ListLabel_20_270"><span class="Internet_20_link"><span class="T34">Downtown / Centre-ville</span></span></a>]. Parents are pushing strollers or holding the hands of their toddlers in the periphery of the scene, in an attempt to avoid the small island of greenery situated in the middle of the boulevard. Adolescents are navigating the sea of people, clutching boutique shopping bags in their hands. All the tables in the myriad of cafes and restaurants around the street are taken, no space to spare, yet some are optimistically gathering around the entrances, waiting for a spot to be freed. At the west end a stage is erected, accessorized with a screen and loudspeakers. It is the meeting point for the supporters of the Ennahdha (<span class="T6">al-nahḍa</span>) movement. “<span class="T6">Al-shaʿb yurīd al-nahḍa min jadīd</span>” (The people want al-Nahda again), the chant is merging with the last accords of “<span class="T6">Hīlā hīlā yā maṭar</span>” (“Come down, oh rain,” a revolutionary song strongly connected to the image of the singer and leftist activist Amel Hamrouni (ʾAmāl al-Ḥamrūnī), an outspoken critic of al-Nahda). At the opposite site of the street some of the members of the Union of Unemployed Graduates (UDC) are banging spoons against empty metal plates, an allusion to both the ongoing hunger strike protesting the current situation of the political opponents of Ben Ali and the economic situation in the country. “Do you know what they want?,” asks one of the policemen protecting the ministry, addressing one of his colleagues, as they observe protesters speaking to their audience while balancing their weight half-way up a couple of tree trunks. The river of bodies is intersected by a tight current. The relatives of the martyrs of the Revolution are walking past determinedly, holding the pictures of their long-lost loved ones. “<span class="T6">Shughl, ḥurriyya, karāma waṭaniyya</span>” (“Work, freedom, national dignity,” one of the slogans of the revolution), shouts someone. In other parts of the boulevard various smaller and bigger associations, political parties and unions are raising their banners, in protest or support of one cause or another. It seems that everyone has something to say. After all, concludes the article, many of the people here do not want to celebrate “but to demonstrate in the name of the unachieved objectives of the Revolution,” to attempt to break the “circle of marginalization and oblivion” (<a href="https://nawaat.org/portail/2016/01/17/in-tunis-demonstrators-are-still-chanting-the-slogans-of-the-revolution/" class="ListLabel_20_267"><span class="Internet_20_link"><span class="T41">Szakal</span></span></a>) [<span class="T23">→</span><a href="Voice_vs_Silence.html" class="ListLabel_20_270"><span class="Internet_20_link"><span class="T34">Voice <em>vs</em> Silence</span></span></a>].</p><p class="Standard">“Celebrating what?

The thousands of young people rotting in prison for smoking a joint! The continuing torture! The criminalization of homosexuality! The rising living costs!” “There is nothing to celebrate!” comes the conclusion, but at least there is beer (<a id="_Hlk525658470"/><a href="https://www.facebook.com/145189922203845/photos/a.145209278868576.27277.145189922203845/996826207040208/" class="ListLabel_20_268"><span class="Internet_20_link"><span class="T7">WillisFromTunis</span></span></a>).</p><p class="Quote">Dear friends, I wish you a happy fifth anniversary of the revolution. I am as disgusted as you are with the turn events took. We wonder how all the vibrant social energies have allowed this band of clowns to dominate the political scene. [<span class="T23">→</span><a href="Hope_vs_Hell.html" class="ListLabel_20_308"><span class="Internet_20_link"><span class="T34">Hope <em>vs</em> Hell</span></span></a>]</p><p class="Standard">Thus opens<a href="http://www.debatunisie.com/archives/2016/01/14/33208125.html" class="ListLabel_20_259"> </a>a post published by the blogger _Z_ on the anniversary of the Tunisian Revolution (<a href="http://www.debatunisie.com/archives/2016/01/14/33208125.html" class="ListLabel_20_268"><span class="Internet_20_link"><span class="T7">DEBATunisie</span></span></a>). The middle of the page-long article is occupied by a vivid image, depicting the Sousse conference (an event held by the ruling Nida Tunis just days after top cabinet posts are reassigned amidst criticism of the role of the president’s son Hafedh Essebsi (Ḥāfiẓ al-Sibsī), which also includes a seven-minute speech by the leader of the rival Islamist part al-Nahda). Surrounded by a cheering, animal-like crowd, Beji Caid Essebsi (Bājī Qāʾid al-Sibsī) is performing fellatio on Rached Ghannouchi (Rāshid al-Ghannūshī). With his mouth full, he turns to his son Hafedh (Ḥāfiẓ), who is scribbling on the constitution and says: “Take a note of what is happening, my son!” The author comments: I know you will excuse the obscenity of this drawing. It is still very far from the vulgarity which contaminates the Tunisian political landscape, which has obviously betrayed the promises of the Revolution. In these sad times, I hope that this January 14 will return to the fundamentals of the revolution and will send a message of support to those who have lost their lives during the revolution, those who still suffer in their flesh and those unable to get out. Understand, my friends, the revolution was never Tunisian, nor was it carried out by the majority. It was a spirit. A breach of the mundane that suddenly opened in an ocean of ever-present bullshit. But it is in this breach that we continue to believe, sums up the article.</p><p class="Standard">But not everybody remembers things like this. “That day was nightmarish,” a girl recalls the eve of the 14<span class="T196">th</span> January in<a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jasmine-revolution-tunisia-anniversary_us_56993211e4b0b4eb759e367c?guccounter=1" class="ListLabel_20_259"> </a>an article published by the <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jasmine-revolution-tunisia-anniversary_us_56993211e4b0b4eb759e367c?guccounter=1" class="ListLabel_20_307"><span class="T6">Huffington Post</span></a>, “We were locked in at home with our family, waiting for the situation to stabilize.” Another witness of the events adds: “I wasn’t happy to see Ben Ali go.

The fifth anniversary of the revolution coincides with the release of the first feature-length movie by Layla Bouzid (Laylà Būzīd). “As I open my eyes” (<span class="T6">ʿAlà ḥallat ʿaynī / À peine j’ouvre les yeux</span>) is set in 2010 and tells the story of Faraḥ, a recently graduated strong-minded young woman who decides to concentrate on working with her band, rather than to study medicine, as her family suggests. The news is received particularly badly by the girl’s overly-protective mother, Ḥayāt, who is determined to keep her safe at home. The political lyrics of the band, however, soon attract the attention of the police. Faraḥ is taken into custody and her mother is left to navigate the complex political and social landscape of Tunis, in an attempt to find her. Eventually, the girl is returned to the family after enduring torture and sexual assault and sinks into depression, her previously rebellious spirit shattered to pieces, while her mother finds her previously lost desire to challenge the status quo. The film is a moving story of the bond between mother and daughter, of the power of love, but also of the ways authoritarian regimes end up awaking their people, while attempting to break them down. And to some it is more than that. “Like any post-totalitarian society, the Tunisian society is navigating around two pitfalls: amnesia and nostalgia, which are connected to each other,”<a href="https://nawaat.org/portail/2016/03/29/a-peine-jouvre-les-yeux-un-film-contre-lamnesie-et-la-nostalgie/" class="ListLabel_20_259"> </a>notes one reviewer (<a id="_Hlk525658760"/><a href="https://nawaat.org/portail/2016/03/29/a-peine-jouvre-les-yeux-un-film-contre-lamnesie-et-la-nostalgie/" class="ListLabel_20_267"><span class="Internet_20_link"><span class="T41">Bin Faraj</span></span></a>). “It is the role of the artist to assist in this navigation, giving their society distant or near images which make them feel and reflect on what is happening.

Gesturing towards the families of the fallen policemen standing behind him, he whispers: “We have paid a high price for the stability and security we currently live in. So, I ask all Egyptians, for the sake of the martyrs to protect their homeland.” Thrown in the mix is also al-Sisi’s strangely out-of-place address to the people of Tunisia, warning them of the dangers of protesting and urging them to keep the country’s interest in mind (<a href="http://www.youm7.com/story/2016/1/23/%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%81%D9%8A%D8%AF%D9%8A%D9%88-%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B5%D9%88%D8%B1-%D9%86%D8%B5-%D9%83%D9%84%D9%85%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B1%D8%A6%D9%8A%D8%B3-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D9%8A%D8%B3%D9%89-%D9%81%D9%89-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%AD%D8%AA%D9%81%D8%A7%D9%84-%D8%A8%D8%B9%D9%8A%D8%AF-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B4%D8%B1%D8%B7%D8%A9/2552332" class="ListLabel_20_261"><span class="Internet_20_link"><span class="T7">al-Yawm al-Sābiʿ</span> [f]</span></a>). </p><p class="Standard">The ceremony takes place two days earlier to separate it from the fifth anniversary of the January Revolution,<a href="https://mideastwire.com/page/articleFree.php?id=59592" class="ListLabel_20_259"> </a><a href="https://mideastwire.com/page/articleFree.php?id=59592" class="ListLabel_20_259">according to </a><span class="T6">al-ʾAkhbār</span> <span class="T6">Lebanon</span>.

On the 25<span class="T196">th</span> itself some supporters of the regime also take to the streets, their faces painted in the colours of the Egyptian flag, offering flowers, hugs and kisses to any policeman they meet. Two young men, however, have a very different gift in mind.</p><p class="Standard">A short video, shot with a mobile phone, shows Ahmad Malik (ʾAḥmad Malik) and Shady Hussain (Shādī Ḥusayn) roaming the streets around Tahrir square, <span class="T6">shaʿbī</span> music playing in the background [<a id="OLE_LINK4"/><a id="OLE_LINK3"/><span class="T23">→</span><a href="Mobile_Phones.html" class="ListLabel_20_311"><span class="Internet_20_link"><span class="T79">Mobile Phones</span></span></a>].

The youths wave the Egyptian flag and kiss the ground, in a seamless, albeit over-exaggerated, imitation of al-Sisi’s supporters around them. “Long live Egypt” shouts one of them, barely able to contain his laughter. The public is let in on the joke. The clip starts in a shady apartment and pictures a group of amused young people inflating and decorating a bunch of condoms, the unusual balloons later so graciously received by the unwitting representatives of the police force (<a id="_Hlk525660225"/><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/satirical-video-of-egyptians-giving-police-condom-balloons-could-land-filmmakers-in-jail-a6836071.html" class="ListLabel_20_267"><span class="Internet_20_link"><span class="T41">Hindāwī</span></span></a>).

The hysteria and schizophrenia which characterizes the polarization in Egypt and which are strengthened by the recent developments in Turkey are not likely to give any answers.

What is more, continues the author, it had changed society as a whole, providing Egyptians with ideals to inspire to. All the demonstrations from the 1970s and 1980s are linked to this change, they were aimed at correcting the course of the revolution and so was the January uprising. “The January Revolution came to save the 23<span class="T196">rd</span> July, which was lost or almost lost,” it came to complete the project that had started 51 years ago. This is the soundest evidence of the importance of the July revolution.

I resent the person who pulled the trigger. I resent those who gloated as my sister was dying.” The pain of knowing what happened is only matched by the thought that you may never find out. “He went, and never came back.

Following the June revolution, supporters of the ousted leader of the Muslim Brotherhood had occupied the Rabaa square, organizing “an armed sit-in.” The protesters had not only closed the roads around the square but had harassed the people living in the area. They had prevented them from leaving their apartments and going to work, violently responding to any attempt to pass by the sit-in. The MB supporters had even seized the near-by mosque and hospital, setting up rooms for detention and torture, the report goes on. Responding to complaints by locals, the security forces had tried to disperse the crowds, but the protesters have thrown stones and Molotov cocktails and had used firearms, leaving one policeman dead. After exhausting all peaceful methods, both locally and internationally, of persuading the people to leave, the security forces had begun to clear up the square. The protesters, however, had once again responded with violence, injuring policemen. The state apparatus had had no choice but to adopt equal measures, resulting in “some injuries and casualties” among those gathered at Rabaa. It is clear, the article concludes, that it was the organizers of the protest that are to blame for the violence that took place, even though now they are using the events to portray themselves as victims. The armed forces of the state? They were just doing their job (<a href="https://www.youm7.com/story/2016/8/14/%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%88%D8%AB%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%82-%D8%A3%D8%B3%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D9%81%D8%B6-%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A8%D8%B9%D8%A9-%D9%85%D9%86-%D8%A3%D8%B1%D8%B4%D9%8A%D9%81-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%A8%D8%A9-%D9%82%D8%A7%D8%AF%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A5%D8%AE%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%B6%D8%AD%D9%88%D8%A7/2842752" class="ListLabel_20_261"><span class="Internet_20_link"><span class="T7">al-Yawm al-Sābiʿ</span> [h]</span></a>) [<span class="T23">→</span><a href="Security_vs_Fear.html" class="ListLabel_20_270"><span class="Internet_20_link"><span class="T34">Security <em>vs</em> Fear</span></span></a>].</p><p class="Standard">But there is another group of people who look back at Rabaa often, as a conversation among representatives of Egypt’s pro-democratic forces,<a href="https://www.madamasr.com/en/2016/07/10/feature/politics/questions-about-june-30-who-were-we-and-what-were-we-thinking-part-2/" class="ListLabel_20_259"> </a><a href="https://www.madamasr.com/en/2016/07/10/feature/politics/questions-about-june-30-who-were-we-and-what-were-we-thinking-part-2/" class="ListLabel_20_259">recoded by </a><span class="T7">MadàMaṣr</span>, shows. “Wasn’t there a fascist sentiment that actually wanted to close public space [among those who took to the streets on June 30]?,” asks Nael al-Toukhy (Nāʾil al-Ṭūkhī). “That does not mean that people wanted to slaughter the Brotherhood. If 100 were slaughtered instead of 1,000, nobody would have been upset. And, if no one was slaughtered, even better,” comes Amr Abdel Rahman’s (ʿAmr ʿAbd al-Raḥmān) answer. Elham Eidaros (ʾIlhām ʿAydārūs) disagrees. According to him, people’s mood for blood was building up in light of the panic from repeated sexual and sectarian attacks. “The Islamic current bears the responsibility for preparing the masses for higher levels of oppression,” argues the activist, bringing elements of the official discourse. All the Brotherhood arrests and even the Rabaa sit-in dispersal were celebrated until very late, adds to the confusion Belal Alaa (Bilāl ʿAlāʾ). The opposition of the democratic forces to “the violent public sentiment” is “coming too late.” Justifying, shifting the blame, taking responsibility: just some of the ways in which the participants in the June movement are trying to deal with the implications and memory of their past decisions (<a href="https://www.madamasr.com/en/2016/07/10/feature/politics/questions-about-june-30-who-were-we-and-what-were-we-thinking-part-2/" class="ListLabel_20_316"><span class="T6">MadàMaṣr</span> [b]</span></a>).</p><p class="Standard">How can a massacre be justified, celebrated, erased from history? These are the questions raised by a <span class="T7">MadàMaṣr</span> article. The Rabaa massacre, like any mass killing, begins the author, happened because the perpetrators succeeded in depriving their victims of the right to exist. Its biggest tragedy is not the loss of life but the loss of consciousness. The slaughtered MB supporters ceased to be part of Egypt. They became “an “other,” an opposing “other,” an “other” that we perceive as different and it perceives us as different, an “other” who we can dress in the devil’s mask, incite hatred against as an enemy, and erase from existence.” And this is what paved the way to “cheap murder, accompanied with jubilation and cheering for victory.” Even those from the civilian camp who acknowledge the victims do not see them as their martyrs, but those of the “other.” They are merely pitied because all is ill-gotten. Rabaa, thus, is not a tragedy only of the Brotherhood, but of the Revolution as a whole, because the legitimization of the massacre solidifies the discourse of the counter-revolution. It changes the battle from one based on political and social issues to one based on identity. And it turns into something that cannot be won, until one truth is accepted: There are no devils among us, just people with power and those who they deprive of “bread, freedom and social justice,”
